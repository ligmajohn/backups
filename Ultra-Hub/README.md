#### Why should I use Ultra Hub over the competitors like Dark Hub/Solaris Hub?
We have three reasons why:
1. We are the first hub to support over 200 supported games.
2. It's features are sure to make you never loose to an anticheat.
3. Unlike our competitors, we don't have a key system.


### Further Information

### What happened to the discord?

It got nuked by Ligma again (no this is not a "ligma" joke).

### What happened to the GitHub?

Ligma had owner permissions so he deleted it because he got mad that no one was giving him nitro (not a "ligma" joke, again).

<div>&nbsp;</div>

### What happened to *your* GitHub account?

GitHub falsely flagged my account.

### Will Ultra Hub ever die?

Never!

### Will you still be adding support for more games?

Obviously. Just request a game and it'll be added.
