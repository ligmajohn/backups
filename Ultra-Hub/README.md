## Why should I use Ultra Hub over the competitors like Dark Hub/Solaris Hub?

We have three reasons why:
- We are the first hub to support over 200 supported games.
- It's features are sure to make you never loose to an anticheat.
- Unlike our competitors, we don't have a key system.


## Further Information

### What happened to the discord?

It got nuked by some mad person lmao.

### Will Ultra Hub ever be discontinued?

Never!

### Will you still be adding support for more games?

Obviously. Just request a game in our [discord](https://discord.gg/PgsZ8Rx5) and it'll be added.
